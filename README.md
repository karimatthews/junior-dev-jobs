# Junior Dev Jobs

This app aims to fill a gap in the Melbourne software development community. Currently, junior developers looking for opportunites must scroll through hundreds of irrelevant jobs on SEEK and Indeed and constantly monitor the websites of promising companies in order to find opportunites. This is somewhat mitigated by targeted mailing lists and networking, but these resources take time to build, and not all aspiring developers have equal opportunities.

Junior Dev Jobs gathers all these opportunities into one place and and updates users through email subscriptions (still coming). No sign in is required and and jobs can be added by anyone (although they are regularly monitored for spam).
